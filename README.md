Predicting Synthetic social media activity data for trend and sentiment analysis

1. Problem definition:
How can we identify spikes or drops in engagement, analyze changes in sentiment over time, build dashboards for digital trend tracking, and test algorithms for sentiment analysis or trend prediction

2. Goal:
Our model is supposed to predict synthetic social media activity data for trend and sentiment analysis

3. Data:
The data is downloaded from the Kaggle Social Media Engagement Dataset (https://www.kaggle.com/datasets/subashmaster0411/social-media-engagement-dataset)

4. Approach: ML models:-
"Logistic Regression": LogisticRegression(),
"KNN": KNeighborsClassifier(),
"Random Forest": RandomForestClassifier() *RandomForest: RandomForestRegressor()

5. Deployment:
Our model will be used in practice to do the following:

Identify spikes or drops in engagement,
Analyze changes in sentiment over time,
Build dashboards for digital trend tracking
6. Evaluations Metrics:
If we can reach 95% accuracy at predicting whether or not there is a drop in engagement, and changes in sentiment over time.

7. Features:
This machine-generated dataset simulates social media engagement data across various metrics, including likes, shares, comments, impressions, sentiment scores, toxicity, and engagement growth. It is designed for analysis and visualization of trends, buzz frequency, public sentiment, and user behavior on digital platforms
